This is the program to give out solution for a cubic function in Latex form.
The program will accept integer or rational number(x/y with x,y are integers).

The program use integer as a base starage type for operation. It can reduce fractions to its irreducible form.Root reduction is not an available feature.

The result is in Latex format.Please copy the result in this program to https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php in order to get a mathematical expression of that result.

Accepted input methods: a, a/b with a, b are integers.
	
Equation to solve: A*X^3 + B*X^2 + C*X + D = 0
